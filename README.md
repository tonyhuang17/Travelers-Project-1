# SWAPI Project 1

This is a project by Anthony Huang and Ben Fiore.

The project adds functional pages for Star Wars films and planets which can be navigated to through clicking the associated buttons within a Star Wars character profile.
The films and planet pages then display some basic information as well as characters/planets/films which are associated with the page.
These characters/planets/films can also be clicked to navigate to the associating page.
